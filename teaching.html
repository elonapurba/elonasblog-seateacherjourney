              <h2>Teaching Practice</h2>

              <h3>Procedure of Teaching</h3>
              <p>During my teaching practice at FEU Roosevelt College, I implemented a structured approach to teaching that emphasized clear procedures. Each lesson began with a brief introduction where I outlined the objectives and expectations for the day. I followed this with direct instruction, using multimedia presentations to engage students and provide context for the material. After presenting new concepts, I facilitated guided practice through collaborative activities, allowing students to work in pairs or small groups. This was followed by independent practice where students applied what they had learned through individual assignments. Finally, I concluded each lesson with a recap and reflection, encouraging students to share their thoughts and questions.</p>
              <div class="center-image">
                <img src="aset/teachingpractice3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
            </div>
      
              <h3>Time Management and Organizing Activities</h3>
              <p>Effective time management was crucial during my teaching practice. I began each lesson by allocating specific time frames for each segment—introduction, instruction, guided practice, independent work, and closure. Using a timer helped keep both myself and the students accountable for staying on track. I also organized activities in a way that maximized engagement; for instance, I alternated between group discussions and individual tasks to maintain student interest and energy levels. Additionally, I prepared materials in advance and ensured that technology was functioning properly before class began. This preparation allowed for a smooth transition between activities and minimized downtime.</p>
              <div class="center-image">
                <img src="aset/teachingpractice2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
            </div>
      
              <h3>Classroom Management</h3>
              <p>Classroom management strategies were essential in creating a positive learning environment. At the start of my teaching practice, I established clear rules and expectations for behavior, which I communicated to the students on the first day. I employed positive reinforcement techniques to encourage participation and good behavior, such as praise and small rewards for active engagement. Additionally, I used non-verbal cues to manage classroom dynamics effectively; for example, raising my hand signaled students to quiet down and pay attention. When minor disruptions occurred, I addressed them calmly and privately to avoid embarrassing any student in front of their peers. Overall, these strategies helped maintain order and fostered a respectful atmosphere conducive to learning.</p>
              
              <h3>Problem-Solving While Teaching and Staying in the Designated School</h3>
              <p>Throughout my teaching practice, I encountered various challenges that required problem-solving skills. One significant issue was managing varying levels of student engagement; some students were highly motivated while others struggled to stay focused. To address this, I differentiated my instruction by providing additional support materials for struggling students and offering enrichment activities for those who excelled. Additionally, technical difficulties with classroom technology occasionally arose; when this happened, I quickly adapted by using alternative methods such as printed handouts or whiteboard explanations to ensure that learning continued without interruption.</p>
              <p>Staying at the designated school also presented its own set of challenges, such as adapting to the school's culture and building rapport with students quickly. To overcome this, I made an effort to learn students' names early on and engaged them in informal conversations before class started. This helped create a more comfortable environment where students felt valued and respected.</p>
              <p>In the middle of my teaching, I also faced some language barriers, as some students were not fluent in English and preferred to communicate in Tagalog. To address this, I often reminded students to use English and encouraged them to ask their peers for translations. My cooperative teacher also assisted in providing translations when necessary.</p>
